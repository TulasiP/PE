Subarray Products:
We define a subarray of an array, numbers, to be a contiguous block of numbers' elements having a length that is less than or equal to the length of the numbers array. For example, the subarrays of numbers = [1,2,3] are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [2,3] and [1,2,3]. If we were to then find the products for each respective subarray, they would be 1, 2, 3, 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 3 = 6 and 1 x 2 x 3 = 6

Complete the count function in the editor below. It has two parameters:
1. An array of n integers, numbers.
2. An integer, k.

The function must return a long integer denoting the total number of subarrays where the product of the subarray's elements are less than k.

Input Format:
Locked stub code in the editor reads the following input from stdin and passes it to the function.
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the size of the nubmers array.
Each line i of the n subsequent lines (where 0 <= i < n) contains an integer describing numbers sub i.
The last line contains a single integer denoting k.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 5 x 10 pow 5
1 <= numbers sub i <= 10 pow 2, where numbers sub i is the ith element of the numbers array.
1 <= k <= 10 pow 6

Output Format:
The function must return a long integer denoting the total number of subarrays having products less than k. This is printed to stdout by locked stub code in the editor.

Explanation 0:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]. We have the following 6 subarrays:
[1] with a product of 1.
[2] with a product of 2.
[3] with a product of 3.
[1,2] with a product of 1 x 2 = 2
[2,3] with a product of 2 x 3 = 6
[1,2,3] with a product of 1 x 2 x 3 = 6

The only subarrays having products less tha k = 4 are [1], [2], [3] and [1,2] so the function returns 4

Sample Input 1:
3

7

Sample Output 1:
6

Explanation 1:
numbers = [1, 2, 3]. We have the following 6 subarrays:
[1] with a product of 1.
[2] with a product of 2.
[3] with a product of 3.
[1,2] with a product of 1 x 2 = 2
[2,3] with a product of 2 x 3 = 6
[1,2,3] with a product of 1 x 2 x 3 = 6

All six of the above subarrays have products less than k = 7, so the function returns 6.
